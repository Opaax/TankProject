# Tank Project
Personnal Tank project which is currently WIP.

The tank is construct to be modular. (I thought about tank customization)

For now I do have:
- Pool manager that can handle all my pools for any bullets type (I decided to go with physical shoot instead of trace)
- Character tank basic movement (not physical)
- Primary shoot
