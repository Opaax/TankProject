# Tank Project
Personal Tank project which is currently WIP.

The tank is constructed to be modular. (I thought about tank customization)

For now, I do have:
- Pool manager that can handle all my pools for any bullets type (I decided to go with physical shoot instead of the trace)
- Character tank basic movement (not physical)
- Primary shoot
